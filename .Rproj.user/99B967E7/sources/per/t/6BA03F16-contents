# Method description

The R package __CCMO__ implements powerful statistical methods for disease-gene association analysis using case-control mother-offspring data.

The data for each mother-offspring pair are $(D,G^c,G^m,X)$, where $D$ is the disease status of the offspring (should be coded as 1 for case and 0 for control), $G^c$ and $G^m$ are the genotypes of offspring and mother, and $X$ is a $p$-vector of maternal covariates. 

Suppose a SNP has two alleles A and B (B is the minor allele), then genotypes can be coded either as 0 (for genotype AA), 1 (for genotype AB), or 2 (for genotype BB). Alternatively, the genotypes can be normalized according to specified mode of inheritance
\begin{itemize}
\item Additive: 0 for AA, 1/2 for AB, and 1 for BB;
\item Recessive: 0 for AA or AB, 1 for BB;
\item Dominant: 0 for AA, 1 for AB or BB.
\end{itemize}
In what follows, we adopt the normalized genotypes.

The method assumes that the offspring genotype is conditional independent of the maternal covariates given maternal covariates. The penetrance model is as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\mbox{pr}(D=1|G^o,G^m,X)\\
&=&\mbox{expit}(\beta_0+\beta_{G^c}G^c+\beta_{G^m}G^m+\beta_oX_o+\beta_{G^cX}G^cX_c+\beta_{G^mX}G^mX_m+\beta_{G^cG^m}G^cG^m),
\end{eqnarray*}
where expit$(t)=e^t/(1+e^t)$, $X_o$, $X_c$, and $X_m$ are functions of the covariates $X$, $\beta_{G^c}$ and $\beta_{G^m}$ are main genetic effects for offspring (child) and mother, respectively, $\beta_o$ is the main maternal environmental effect, $\beta_{G^cX}$ is the offspring gene-environment interaction effct, $\beta_{G^mX}$ is the maternal gene-environment interaction effect, and $\beta_{G^cG^m}$ is the gene-gene interaction effect. The maternal genotype is associated with the maternal covariates through the following double additive logit (daLOG) model:
$$\mbox{pr}(G^m=1|X)=\frac{\xi(\theta,F)e^{k\eta'X_{G^m}}}{\sum_l\xi_l(\theta,F)e^{l\eta'X_{G^m}}},$$
where $\eta$ is a regression parameter vector, $X_{G^m}$ is a function of $X$, $\xi_k(\theta,F)$ is the probability of $G^m=k$ with $\theta$ being the minor allele frequency and $F$ being the inbreeding coefficient. 

The penetrance model for POEs is as follows:
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\mbox{pr}(D=1|G^c,G^m,G^c_m,G^c_p,X)\\
&=&\mbox{expit}(\beta_0+\beta_{G^c}G^c+\beta_{G^m}G^m+\beta_{POE}(G^c_m-G^c_p)+\beta_{X}X),
\end{eqnarray*}
$\beta_{G^c}$ and $\beta_{G^m}$ are main genetic effects for offspring (child) and mother, respectively, $\beta_X$ is the main maternal environmental effect, $\beta_{POE}$ is the parent-of-origin effect. The genotypes should be coded either as 0 (for genotype AA), 1 (for genotype AB), or 2 (for genotype BB) and we consider using haplotypes data to improve the test power for POEs. Thus, the inputs for the POEs test function _MultiLociPOE_ shoud include the diplotypes of the mother-child pairs. Users can use function _MultiLociPOE.input_ to get the inputs of _MultiLociPOE_. 



The usage of the functions _singleSNP_ and _multipleSNP_ are as follows:
\begin{description}
\item singleSNP(Y, Gc, Gm, Xo = NULL, Xc = NULL, Xm = NULL, X.Gm = NULL,
  G.main = c("Gc", "Gm"), G.int = FALSE, mode = "add", prev = 0.01,
  ind = FALSE, HWE = TRUE, normalized.genotype = FALSE)

\item multipleSNP(Y, Gc, Gm, Xo = NULL, Xc = NULL, Xm = NULL,
  X.Gm = NULL, G.main = c("Gc", "Gm"), G.int = FALSE, mode = "add",
  prev = 0.01, ind = FALSE, HWE = TRUE,
  normalized.genotype = FALSE, test = NULL)
\end{description}

Users should specify $X_c$, $X_m$, $X_o$, $X_{G^m}$ according to their requirements, each of them can be omitted in the model by setting it to be the default value _NULL_. Each of the two main genetic effects can be included in the penetrance model by specifying _G.main_, and the gene-gene interaction effect can be included by setting _G.int_ to be _TRUE_. 

The mode of inheritance can be specified through _mode_ ('rec' for recessive, 'add' for additive, 'dom' for dominant). Hardy-Weiberg equilibrium can be incorporated in the method through _HWE_. The independence of $G^m$ and $X$ can be incorprated by setting _ind_ to be _TRUE_. 

The usage of the function _MultiLociPOE_ is as follows:

\begin{description}
\item MultiLociPOE(Y,gmm,gcc,X,loci,hap,f,ppi)
\end{description}

Users should specify loci and f according to their requirements. And make sure that the genotypes are coded either as 0 (for genotype AA), 1 (for genotype AB), or 2 (for genotype BB).

\begin{description}
\item MultiLociPOE.input(gmm,gcc,type)
\end{description}

Users can use _MultiLociPOE.input_ to get the inputs for _MultiLociPOE_. Users should specify _type_ corresponding to the format of the genotype data. Here, '0' stands for genotype coded as 0, 1, 2; '1' stands for normalized genotype coded as 0, 1/2, 1; '2' standsfor genotype coded like "A/A", "A/B", "B/B".

# Illustration of _singleSNP_

We use the dataset contained in the R package for illustration.
```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(CCMO)
data("SampleData",package="CCMO")
dim(SampleData)
head(SampleData)
```

This dataset has maternal and offspring genotypes for 10 SNPs and two maternal covariates from 2000 mother-offspring pairs. Here we analyze the first SNP. Suppose we are interested in two main genetic effects, maternal gene-environment interaction effects, and offspring gene-environment interaction effects. The R code for analyzing the data is as follows:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
# library(CCMO)
Y = SampleData[,1]
Gc = SampleData[,2]
Gm = SampleData[,12]
X = SampleData[,-(1:21)]
fit = singleSNP(Y,Gc,Gm,Xo=X,Xc=X,Xm=X,X.Gm=X)
```

The result is a list containing the following elements:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
names(fit)
```

The estimation and significance test results produced by the new method are
```{r,eval=FALSE}
fit$new
```
The variance-covariance matrix of the estimates by the new method is stored in
```{r,eval=FALSE}
fit$cov.new
```
The corresponding results by the standard logistic regression are included for comparison
```{r,eval=FALSE}
fit$log
fit$cov.log
```

# Illustration of _OmnibusTest_

Multiple effects can be simultineously tested using the function _OmnibusTest_. Suppose we want to test four gene-environment interaction effects simultineously, then we should specify the indices of the two interaction effects when call _OmnibusTest_: 
```{r,eval=FALSE}
fit = OmnibusTest(fit,test=7:10)
fit$Omnibus
```
The results include the Wald test statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value for each of two methods (i.e., _new_ and _log_).

# Illustration of _multipleSNP_

Suppose we want to analyze the 10 SNPs simultaneously. The function _multipleSNP_ calls multiple CPU cores to save computational time, as shown below
```{r,eval=FALSE}
Gc = SampleData[,2:11]
Gm = SampleData[,12:21]
system.time(fit1 <- multipleSNP(Y,Gc,Gm,Xo=X,Xc=X,Xm=X,X.Gm=X,cores=1))
system.time(fit2 <- multipleSNP(Y,Gc,Gm,Xo=X,Xc=X,Xm=X,X.Gm=X,cores=2))
```
Of course, the saved computational time depends on the number of CPU cores. The output is a list of length 10 (the number of SNPs). For example, the results of the 2nd SNP can be assessed through
```{r,eval=FALSE}
fit2[[2]]
```
Omnibus test can be carried out by specifying the target variable indices through _test_:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
fit <- multipleSNP(Y,Gc,Gm,Xo=X,Xc=X,Xm=X,X.Gm=X,test=7:10)
fit[[2]]$Omnibus
```

# Illustration of _MultiLociPOE_

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# library(CCMO)
Y = POESampleData[,1]
gmm = POESampleData[,2:6]
gcc = POESampleData[,7:11]
X = POESampleData[,12]
data = MultiLociPOE.input(gmm,gcc,0)
gmm = data$gmm
gcc = data$gcc
hap = data$hap
ppi = data$ppi
loci = 1
f = 0.01
fit = MultiLociPOE(Y,gmm,gcc,X,loci,hap,f,ppi)
```

The result is a list containing the following elements:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
names(fit)
```

The estimation and significance test results produced by the new method are
```{r,eval=FALSE}
fit$new
```
The variance-covariance matrix of the estimates by the new method is stored in
```{r,eval=FALSE}
fit$cov.new
```
The corresponding results by the standard logistic regression are included for comparison
```{r,eval=FALSE}
fit$log
fit$cov.log
```
